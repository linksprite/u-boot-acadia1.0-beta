Subject: [PATCH 354/691] ENGR00156670-2 MMC: Fixed some bugs in common code

Need to send RCA when sending CMD13.

Cannot use print_size function when displaying card capacity
because it expects a 32 bit integer as input, while mmc->capacity
is a 64 bit integer. There is loss of information leading to incorrect
capacities being displayed for "mmcinfo" cmd. Changed it to simply
print the entire 64 bit integer, which is the number of bytes.
